# Zipper
This is a utility class that compresses files and folders into a zip-file.
It's a fully documented class that shows one way of dealing with folder compression.
While file compression is pretty straight forward, compressing folders and subfolders programmatically can be tricky.
Here a simple form of recursion is used to do it. It's been tested and works with image, audio and text.
